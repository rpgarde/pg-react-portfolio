                <p className = "mt-2">
                  My focus has been on <span className = "fw-bold">Web Development</span> featuring <span className = "fw-bold">React, Typescript, GraphQL,</span> and 
                  both <span className = "fw-bold">SQL</span> and <span className = "fw-bold">NoSQL (MongoDB)</span> databases. 
                  In 2021, I finished up a coding bootcamp at The University of Sydney, where I graduated with an A+ average.
